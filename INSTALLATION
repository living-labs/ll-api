Installation
============

You can clone the repo with all Living Labs Challenge's code as follows:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:living-labs/ll-challenge.git

Then, installing the python prerequisites is easy:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note: If you don't have pip yet, install it using "easy_install pip".

In case you want to run your own version of the API (for testing purposes), you'll also need to install and run MongoDb.


Building Documentation
----------------------

To build the docs, run these commands in a shell:

.. sourcecode:: bash
    
    $ cd doc
    $ make html

The documentation will appear in doc/build/html.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If you receive the following error when building the documentation:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
    make: *** [html] Error 1

The, add these lines to your ~/.bash_profile:

.. sourcecode:: bash
    
    export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
