Installation
============

You can clone the repo with all Living Labs Challenge's code as follows::

    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:living-labs/ll-challenge.git

Then, installing the python prerequisites is easy::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note: If you don't have pip yet, install it using "easy_install pip".

In case you want to run your own version of the API (for testing purposes), you'll also need to install and run MongoDb.


Building Documentation
----------------------

To build the docs::
    
    $ cd doc
    $ rm -r build && make html

The documentation will appear in docs/build/html.
