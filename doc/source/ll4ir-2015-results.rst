LL4IR Official Results
======================

This page presents the official results for the LL4IR CLEF 2015 Lab.

#Impressions is the total number of times when rankings (for any of the test queries) from the given team/system have been displayed to users.
The number of wins, losses, and ties are calculated against the production system, where a win is defined as the experimental system having more clicks on results assigned to it by Team Draft Interleaving than clicks on results assigned to the production system.
Outcome is defined as #wins/(#wins+#losses). An outcome value below 0.5 means that the experimental system performed worse than the production system (i.e., in overall, it has more losses than wins).

Participants can request the outcomes, for the entire query set (both test and train) as well as for each query individually, via the :ref:`corresponding API endpoint <api-participants_outcome>`.
