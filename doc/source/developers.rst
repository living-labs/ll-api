Information for developers
==========================
If you would like to modify the LivingLabs API, first follow the API
installation tutorial.

Run end-to-end test
-------------------
After you made changes to the code, you can run an end-to-end test to check if
everything works properly. The test will setup a clean database, run the API
and test a site and participant. Afterwards everything is cleaned
up. To run the test, go to the root directory of the repository and issue:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ nosetests


Coding Style
------------
Core functionality should go in ll/core, the API (in ll/api) and Dashboard
(in ll/dashboard) the user this functionality.

Clients (in ll/client) are used for testing purposes and serve as baseline.

We (try to) stick to PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ .


Building Documentation
----------------------
.. note::  you probably don't have to build the documentation. A constantly
	updated version is available here: http://doc.living-labs.net/ .

Our documentation is created with Sphinx and comes largely directly from source
code. This makes it very easy to keep the documentation in sync with the code.

If you updated the documentation and want to test it, run these
commands in a shell from the root of the repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash
    
    $ cd doc
    $ make html
    $ open doc/build/html/index.html


If you receive the following error when building the documentation:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
    make: *** [html] Error 1

Then, add these lines to your ~/.bash_profile:

.. sourcecode:: bash
    
    export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

Replicating the MongoDB database
--------------------------------
To copy the MongoDB database from one server to another, an elegant solution is `replication`. Replication is supported by MongoDB: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/replication/
The current database is the `primary` database, from which data is copied to the new, `secondary` database.
In this section, we will roughly follow the steps taken in the following tutorial: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/
However, we will also take into account the case that users have already been created on the old database and other
specificalities for LivingLabs.

Setup user roles on old database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have users on your current database, one of the users should get the :code:`clusterManager` role. This will grant this user
the right to initiate the replication set, as soon as Mongo is in replication set mode.

To grant `admin` the :code:`clusterManager` role:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ mongo -u admin -p --authenticationDatabase admin
       > use admin
       > db.grantRolesToUser("admin",{role:"clusterManager", db:"admin"})
       > exit

If you have not set up any users, logging in with the anonymous user will automatically enable you to initiate the
replication set.

Change database configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The configuration of both the current and the new database have to be changed, in order to be able to connect with eachother.
This can be done by changing the configuration file and restarting :code:`mongod`, or by restarting :code:`mongod` while supplying options via the command line.
The following options have to be set:
- :code:`replSet`, with as argument the same replication set name for both databases
- :code:`keyFile`, with as argument the path of a keyfile. This keyfile has to be the same for both databases. Generate a keyfile: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/generate-key-file/

The :code:`bindIp` option restricts the access to the database to a certain IP address. Although this may be a bit safer, it is best to remove the option if you experience any trouble connecting.

Initiate replication set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now both databases run in replication mode, we should quickly set up the replication set. Sometimes, the database
does not function properly if this has not yet been done.

On the `current` database (important, because we want this one to be `primary`), instantiate the replication set:

Log in to the Mongo shell (in this example with authenticaiton) and execute :code:`rs.initiate()`:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ mongo -u admin -p --authenticationDatabase admin
       > rs.initiate()

After a while, the replication set is set up. You can check its status with :code:`rs.status()` and its configuration
with :code:`rs.config()`. You can also give the current member (the old database) a higher priority (for example 10), so it
will be chosen primary in elections: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/force-member-to-be-primary/

Now, again in the Mongo shell, add the new database to the replication set. Make sure MongoDB runs on the given external port of the new server:

.. sourcecode:: bash
       > rs.add("ip-address:port")

Congratulations, the replication set has been created and the data will be replicated!


SELinux troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using a CentOS machine (or other operating system that uses SELinux), you will get into trouble when
starting :code:`mongod` as a service. The SELinux security system can prohibit :code:`mongod` rights, like using certain
ports.

First, temporarily turn off the enforcement of the SELinux rules:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo setenforce 0

Now, run :code:`mongod`. If the problems were caused by SELinux, MongoDB will be able to run. **However, we do not
want to keep the security turned off.** Therefore, we search for the cases where :code:`mongod` violated a rule and
add exceptions for those rules:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo grep mongod /var/log/audit/audit.log | sudo audit2allow -M mypol
   sudo semodule -i mypol.pp

Now, we can turn on the enforcement of SELinux rules again:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo setenforce 1
