        Obtain feedback for a query. Only feedback for runs you submitted
        will be returned. So, first submit a run, wait a while to give a user
        the chance to enter the query for which you submitted the run.
        Then, wait even longer to given the site the change to feed the click
        back into our API. As soon as all this happens, the feedback will
        become available here.

        You may specify "all" as the query identifier to obtain
        feedback for all queries.

        Note that you may receive multiple feedbacks for a single query as
        it may have been shown to a user more than once. And even if you
        specify a runid, then the rankings for this runid may have been
        presented to users multiple times.
