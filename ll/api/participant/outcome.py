        Obtain outcome (optionally for a query).

        You may omit or specify "all" as the query identifier to obtain
        feedback for all queries.

        Outcome will be aggregate per site and for test and train queries. If
        specify a query, you will only obtain the outcome for this query.
        Otherwise outcomes are aggregated over all queries.

        The "outcome" is computed as: #wins / (#wins + #losses).
        Where a win is defined as the participant having more clicks on
        documents assigned to it by Team Draft Interleaving than clicks
        on documents assigned to the site.

        Outcome for test queries is restricted to the test period. Train
        queries are not restricted in time.
