        Store historical user feedback for a query. This is different from live
        feedback, that can be stored through :http:get:`/api/site/feedback/(key)/(sid)`.

        The feedback can be stored multiple times for the same query, the old
        version will be overwritten, it is not additive.

        .. note::

            It is expected that the doclist is the actual doclist that was
            shown to the user. In case multiple doclists were shown for the
            same query, an average ranking may be returned (documents sorted
            by average rank).
