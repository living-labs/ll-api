        Update (or initialize) the query set. This can only be done before the
        challenge started.

        Per query, you can mark its type: whether the query is supposed to be
        a train, test or eval query. Test queries are supposed to *not* be
        evaluated online. So, participants will (should) not expect any
        feedback for queries other than train queries (during the training
        phase). In fact, we may return an error when you try to
        return feedback for another query. The default query type is "train",
        which is thus also used when the type is omitted.

        Optionally, the "qid" (i.e., not the site_qid) can also be added to
        each query. If this is not done, the query is assigned an automatic
        qid.
