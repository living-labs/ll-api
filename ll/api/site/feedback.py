        Return feedback for a session.

        Store user feedback for a session obtained through
        :http:get:`/api/site/ranking/(key)/(site_qid)`.
        The feedback can be stored multiple times for the same session if more
        feedback comes availaible.
        In that case, the old feedback will be overwritten, it is not additive.
        So if multiple clicks come in one by one, make sure to include all of 
        them each time you update the feedback.

        .. note::

            It is expected that the doclist is the actual doclist that was
            shown to the user.
            This is important because the site may have had to make a last
            minute decisions not to include a certain document.
            It not obtaining a click is valuable information for a participant.
